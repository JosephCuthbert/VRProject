# VR/AR Project

This project was based around being given a basic task in VR with the idea of developing a simple virtual city scene. The main task was 
to create moving vehilces, pedestrians and traffic lights that change in 20 second intervals. After this we were given creative control over any extras we wanted to add, for example the map could be changed, extra buildings, interactivity anything. As long as the base implementations were kept the same. 

A week after the submission deadline, we had to showcase the project to the module leaders. This was where we set up the project on a computer connected to an Oculus Quest, then had the leaders test and question design decisions. One question I had was based on my choice of movement system, where mostly everyone else had used locomotion, or controller movement; Whereas I chose to use teleportation. 

The project should run straight away but will only be interactive with a VR headset. The project will still play but the user will not be able to interact, only spectate.

Thanks for looking at my VR project.
